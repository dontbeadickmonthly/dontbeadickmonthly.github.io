<center>Everything you never wanted to know about Don't Be A Dick Monthly</center>

## Inception

DBADM was created on August 27th 2016 when Jacob Levitt asked Robertson McClure a question regarding religion.
Robertson responded with the phrase _I subscribe to Don't Be A Dick Monthly_. These two men then proceeded to riff on the concept
of an actual monthly magazine that contained articles on how not to be a dick.

And thus **Don't Be A Dick Monthly** was born.
